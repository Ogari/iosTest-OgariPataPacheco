![Platform](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/p/AKVideoImageView.svg)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/numen31337/AKVideoImageView.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/numen31337/AKVideoImageView)

## Motivation

AKVideoImageView was created because I wasn't satisfied with standard Apple AVPlayer during creating a video background for one of my apps. AVPlayer doesn't let the phone to go to sleep mode. Also, you can't insensibly start a video from the first frame when app enters background. This class solves these problems, and in the end, you have a perfect solution for making gorgeous video backgrounds for your apps.

## Features

- Allows the phone to go to the sleep mode
- Ability to dynamically switch videos
- Auto set the first frame of video to have seamless transition when app returns from background
- Minimal memory footprint
- Good performance
- Ability to use mp4 files as video source
- Interface Builder support

## Usage

### Compressing your video file
Before starting using this class, you need to properly compress video.<br /> Here is an example of libx264 compression options on OS X system using ffmpeg utility:
```
ffmpeg -i input.mov -vcodec libx264 -level 3.1 -pix_fmt yuv420p -threads 1 -preset placebo -crf 19 -tune film -x264opts colorprim=bt709:transfer=bt709:colormatrix=bt709:fullrange=off output.mp4
```

### Using Interface Builder
Just drag the `UIImageView` to your `UIView` and set its class to the `AKVideoImageView`. In the Attributes Inspector set the `Video File Name` to the name of your `.mp4` video file without extension. See an example project for more info is needed.

### Using Code

Objective-C:<br />
```objective-c
#import "AKVideoImageView.h"

NSURL *videoURL = [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"videoName" withExtension:@"mp4"];
AKVideoImageView *videoBG = [[AKVideoImageView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds
                                                           videoURL:videoURL];
[self.view addSubview:videoBG];
[self.view sendSubviewToBack:videoBG];
```

Swift:<br />
```swift
import AKVideoImageView

let url = Bundle.main.url(forResource: "video_1", withExtension: "mp4")!
let videoView = AKVideoImageView(frame: view.bounds, videoURL: url)!
view.addSubview(videoView)
```

### Dynamically changing video

```objective-c
NSURL *videoURL = [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"anotherVideoName" withExtension:@"mp4"];
self.videoBG.videoURL = videoURL;
```

## Installation

#### Manually
Just add AKVideoImageView.h and AKVideoImageView.m files to your project.

#### CocoaPods
Add the following line to your Podfile.

```
pod "AKVideoImageView", "~> 1.1"
```

Then run `pod install`.
